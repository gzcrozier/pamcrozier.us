    <img src="images/Mom.jpg" alt="Pam Crozier">
    <p>As your voice in the Indiana House of Representatives I pledge to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on promoting and growing our local economy</li>
        <li>Ensure that our first responders have all the resources they need to keep us safe</li>
        <li>Be a responsible steward of our hard-earned tax dollars</li>
        <li>Always remeber that I am in Indianaoplis to serve YOU</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By never losing sight of these things, as well as my passion for our community, the love of my family, and my faith in God, I aim to help the District 67 become an even better, safer, and freer place to live and raise a family. </p>
