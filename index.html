    <p>As a member of the Jefferson County Council I pledge to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on promoting our local economy</li>
        <li>Ensure that our first responders have all the resources they need</li>
        <li>Be a responsible steward of our hard-earned tax dollars</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By never loosing sight of these things, as well as my passion for our community, I aim to help Jefferson County become an even better, safer, and feer place to live and raise a family. </p>
